Image Resize script

- Changed the header content type to image/jpeg
- Checked if there is a file to be resized
	If there is:
	- $image was used to get the name of the file from the input field
	- $image_size was used to get the array of width, height and image type 
	  from the getimagesize method.
	- $image_width was used to get the value of the width from the $image_size
	- $image_height was used to get the value of the height from the $image_size
	- $image_width was added to $image_height and divided by the result from $image_width 
	  multiplied the result of $image_height divided by 130 and was assigned to
	  $new_size.
	- $new_width specifies the $image_width multiplied by $new_size.
	- $new_height specifies the $image_height multiplied by $new_size.

	- $new_image specifies a new image created using imagecreatetruecolor method 
	  carrying the $new_width and $new_height as parameters.
	- $old_image specifies the imagecreatefromjpeg method with $image passed into it.
	- The imagecopyresized function was called with these parameters
		- $new_image as the destintion image
		- $old_image as the source image
		- 0 as destination x-cordinate value
		- 0 as the destination y-cordinate value
		- 0 as the source x-cordinate value
		- 0 as the source y-cordinate value
		- $new_width as the destination width
		- $new_height as the destination height
		- $image_width as the source width
		- $image_height as the source height
	- imagejpeg method was called with the $new_image as a paramter.



MOTIVATIONS
Writing this code was really not very easy especially when you expected an outcome
you couldn't get it because of errors. 
Debugging this script and making sure i was able to get the required new image as
i wanted was challenging. I was happy when I finally got it and I have gained tremendous 
knowledge from this script.
